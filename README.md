 ### Elevator
 # We are going to imitiate working elevator in example below

 # Normal scenario is like that: 
 1. Elevator starts at the first floor and accept passengers. 
 It might be situation that there are more passengers, that elevator can accept.
 So it accepts as many as it can, depending on amount or total weight of passengers
 2. Also elevator should check if max weight is not exceeded. So, there can be situation
 elevator can accept passengers but max weight is already exceeded
 3. Also there is so special category of passengers, that asking elevator to remind them 
 if they reach their target floor 
 4. Elevator have to deliver passenger(s) to their desired floors 
 5. Elevator should remind passengers that they should leave, in case passengers request such reminder
 6. Elevator should stop elevating if there are no more passengers inside
